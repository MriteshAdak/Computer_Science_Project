Salesforce, as a leading cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, 
provides organizations with a unified environment for managing customer data, sales 
processes and business operations. Despite its extensive data management and analytics 
capabilities, the in-built reporting feature does not have support for Notes and Attachments 
entity, and these objects often have essential files for business compliance. 

Problem Statement: 
This project proposes the development of a tool aimed at addressing the well-documented 
reporting deficiencies associated with Salesforce's file-based data entities. Drawing upon the 
concerns articulated in the Salesforce Idea Exchange post titled “Reporting on Notes & 
Attachments,” the tool seeks to tackle the challenge of generating reports on legacy 
components, to help users be in alignment with the governor's limits established on the 
Salesforce Cloud Platform. Given that the entities in question are legacy components—
 alongside newer entities that Salesforce no longer intends to support, it is imperative to note 
that legacy components remain integral to numerous enterprise applications. The integration of 
the legacy “Notes and Attachments” feature with the contemporary “Enhanced Notes” and 
“Files” into a cohesive interface could facilitate a comprehensive cross-object analysis of files 
relationships and storage metrics, thereby enhancing the experience of platform users. 

Proposed Solution: 
The principal contribution of this study is the enhancement of accessibility to actionable 
analytical data for all categories of users. The proposed tool autonomously associates files with 
their respective parent records—such as Accounts, Opportunities, or Cases—thereby 
establishing verifiable linkages between business transactions and their supporting 
documentation. By facilitating comprehensive reporting on these elements, the tool enables 
users to obtain an integrated perspective on storage consumption relative to allocated quotas. 
Moreover, it is designed to serve as a unified, metadata-driven reporting framework, capable of 
extracting, normalizing, and visualizing information across all file types within the Salesforce 
ecosystem. The resulting insights support analytics for storage optimization, compliance 
auditing, and content governance.
